# ASCIImage-Sharp
A C#/WPF port of [ASCIImage](http://asciimage.org/)

I'm still thinking about the best way to use this in an app, but see [here](ASCIImage.Sample/Arrow.cs) for an example of using it to build a control. You would then be able to use this in your xaml like:
```
<Grid>
    <Arrow />
</Grid>
```
